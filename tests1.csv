"2025-04-14 03:50:00,The 'Nixon Shock' Might Help Us Make Sense Of The Trump One,""The 'Nixon Shock' Might Help Us Make Sense Of The Trump One Submitted by Huw van Steenis via the Financial Times , The author is vice-chair at Oliver Wyman and former global head of banks and diversified financials research at Morgan Stanley What will the longer-term financial consequences of Trump’s tariffs be? We may be in a 90-day pause but the question remains urgent. A look back at Richard Nixon’s experience in 1971 could help investors understand what might happen next. President Richard Nixon addresses Congress to explain his new economic policy in 1971 © AP Certainly recent events share some hallmarks with the “Nixon shock”, which occurred when the then president took the dollar off the gold standard, implemented a 10 per cent import tariff and introduced temporary price controls . This de-anchoring of the regime resulted in a period of global economic instability and uncertainty. It not only caused a loss in business confidence but led to stagflation. Nixon’s price and wage controls spectacularly backfired, triggering product shortages and helping to fuel a wage-price spiral. The whole episode was a pivotal contributor to the huge inflation of the ’70s. As with Trump’s tariffs, Nixon’s were introduced to cudgel countries into changing the terms of trade to help reduce the US trade deficit. His biggest concerns were Japan and Germany. “ My philosophy, Mr President, is that all foreigners are out to screw us and it’s our job to screw them first, ” Treasury secretary John Connally had said to him. In today’s hyperfinancialised world, we have already seen that bond markets can force the hands of politicians far more quickly. It took four months in 1971 before Nixon’s tariffs were removed via the Smithsonian agreement. But the shock had already done enough to catalyse extraordinary changes in finance, leading to the creation of new instruments to bet on the direction of interest rates and hedge currency risk, including FX futures and options. The pain of stagflation in the banking system prompted a huge change in financial behaviour and financial regulation . Investors shifted asset allocation to gold and real assets to preserve value . Meanwhile corporates and depositors increasingly moved their activities from banks to bond markets . Bank lending as a share of total borrowing in the economy has been falling ever since. In short, modern finance was forged in the early 1970s. There are parallels as well for countries outside the US currently worrying about tariffs. Back in 1971 there was also shoddy treatment for the US’s closest allies. Nixon hit Canada with tariffs despite its currency already floating. Like Prime Minister Mark Carney today, Canadians didn’t back down and eventually the tariffs were removed. It could have been even worse: Connally had also wanted the US to withdraw from a long-standing pact with Canada on cars and auto parts. But Paul Volcker fixed that, according to his memoirs, by cheekily encouraging a State Department official to tear off the last page of every press release which mentioned it. Ultimately, the need to stabilise international relations with allies helped tip the balance away from the tariffs. Henry Kissinger, then the national security adviser, “grew concerned about the unsettling impact of a prolonged confrontation on allied relationships”. Nixon also put huge pressure on the Fed for expansionary monetary policy to offset the shock. William Safire, Nixon’s speechwriter, recounts how the administration kept up a steady stream of anonymous leaks to pressure Fed chair Arthur Burns , including floating one proposal to expand the size of the Federal Reserve, so that Nixon could pack the committee with supportive new members. At the end of it all, Nixon’s four-month tax may have helped facilitate dollar revaluation, but it fell short of the desired goals and had no discernible impact on imports. The move’s economic shockwaves, however, rippled through the decades. Even the creation of the euro stems from it. Might a digital euro or deeper European capital markets be next? It’s not yet clear but history suggests the fallout from this latest shock will be felt for years to come. * * * You can support ZeroHedge with the purchase of a waxed canvas hat Click hat... add to cart... check out... receive awesome hat...

"2025-04-14 02:40:00,David Stockman On Why The Houthis Aren't America's Problem,""David Stockman On Why The Houthis Aren't America's Problem Authored by David Stockman via InternationalMan.cm, The ascension to NATO of the Balkan Five (Croatia, Slovenia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Albania) and the Baltic Three (Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia) amounts to some kind of bad joke. Their combined active military forces total just 66,000 servicemen, which is exactly equal to the combined 66,000 man police forces of New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles and Philadelphia. Likewise, their combined defense budgets are $8 billion annually or about the level of Pentagon spending every seven hours, including weekends, holidays, snow days and the Fourth of July parades, military bands and all. And when it comes to economic heft, their collective GDP is a diminutive $350 billion or just 1.3% of that of the USA. So we rightly asked, why bother? Their military manpower, token defense budgets and rounding error GDPs do not have even remote relevance to standing up America’s triad strategic nuclear deterrent, which doesn’t require any foreign bases or allies in any case. Nor do they contribute a whit to an invincible conventional military Fortress America defense of the airspace and shorelines of the US homeland way over here on the far side of the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean moats. And yet and yet. The wee countries of Eastern European NATO actually have some modest throw-weight compared to what’s involved in the raging Yemen bombing leak controversy at the top of today’s the news. Of course, the controversy is all about the leak of what practically amounts to a scheduled bombing run against a tiny spec of an “enemy” on the Red Sea coast. But the far more important question is why in the hell was the Donald bombing the bedraggled Houthi installations in the first place? Or as Ann Coulter expressed it more colorfully, …because right now, his foreign policy team is looking like John Bolton without the ridiculous Wilford Brimley mustache . Since Trump keeps hiring these people, it’s a good time to remind him that, in 2016, he won more primary votes than any Republican in U.S. history (as well as the election) by saying things like this about a war that had a million more justifications than his recent bombing of the Houthis: “Obviously, the war in Iraq was a big, fat mistake. … We spent $2 trillion, thousands of lives … George Bush made a mistake. We can make mistakes. But that one was a beauty. We should have never been in Iraq. We have destabilized the Middle East.” So why does Trump keep surrounding himself with tinhorn cowboys who think it’s America’s responsibility to drone, bomb, invade and occupy other countries whenever and for whatever reason they want? As it happens, the Houthi tribes– who profess a variant of Shiite Islam—have dominated much of northern and western Yemen for centuries. They generally ruled North Yemen during the long expanse after it was established in 1918 until the two Yemen’s were reunified in 1990. So when a Washington installed government in Sana’a was overthrown and the uneasily unified nation of Yemen disintegrated into warring religious factions, the Houthi took power in northern Yemen, while Sunni tribes aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood and al-Qaeda held sway in the south. And these latter folks are far worse on the terrorist scale than the Houthi ever dreamed of being. Needless to say, this Houthi remnant of the failed state of Yemen ain’t no threat to nobody who’s minding their own business. They have no blue water Navy, no Air Force, no regular Army and just some odds and sots of coastal patrol boats and short range drones and missiles. So their ability to inflict even a scratch on the American homeland way over here lies somewhere between slim and none. As indicated, the Houthis rule not the entire sovereign country of Yemen, but roughly 25% of the former Yemen territory (about 137,500 square kilometers out of 550,000), including the capital at Sana’a and key northern population centers. Given that the GDP of the entirety of the Yemen territory was a scant $20 billion in 2024 and that slightly more of the economic activity—now often barter-based after years of USA and Saudi bombing—is under Houthis control, our trusty AI, Grok 3, estimates that in their wisdom the Donald’s purported America Firsters were bombing the shit out of some desert salients which generate a mere $6-8 billion of GDP annually. That’s right. We are talking about a rogue regime of rifle-waving ruffians who control the equivalent of 1oo minutes of US GDP! And, no, ensuring the freedom of navigation in the Red Sea doesn’t have a damn thing to do with it. Thus, in 2023, about 8.7 million barrels per day (b/d) of crude oil and refined products flowed through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait (southern Red Sea entrance), but almost all of that went to Europe. And the tiny 500,000 barrels per day of Persian Gulf oil that went to the US (1% of US energy consumption) could be readily replaced by domestic production anyway under the Donald’s drill, baby drill policy. When it comes to the oil trade through the Red Sea/Suez route, therefore, we are basically talking about profits to the Petro-State producers and costs to European consumers—not anything remotely related to the national security of the American homeland. Likewise, the containership trade is even more irrelevant. The overwhelming share of US destined goods from China, South Korea, Taiwan or elsewhere in the Far East (upwards of $600 billion per year) arrive here via the Pacific Coast and Panama Canal routes to eastern USA, not the Red Sea/Suez route. By contrast, upwards of 75% of the $1 trillion of containership cargo transiting the latter route, goes to Europe. Moreover, in the event that the modest amount of US bound container cargo is diverted to the Cape of Africa route the incremental cost to the US east coast is barely material: At current market levels, the price per TEU is about $264 for the Red Sea-Suez route and $292 for the Cape route, again according to Grok 3. In short, there is no economic case for attempting to bomb the Red Sea into freedom of navigation. And surely there is no basis for claiming that the Houthi, who are a rag-tag tribe of desert insurgents, are a threat to the liberty and security of the American homeland in any way, shape or form. After all, even their Iran-supplied missiles have a maximum range of well less than 1,200 kilometers. Yet the last time we checked, the distance from Yemen to Washington DC was 11,000 kilometers! So to repeat the mantra that could not be more pertinent to the Donald’s inchoate attempt to bring the Empire home: America must not go abroad seeking monsters to destroy, as our sixth president, John Qunicy Adams, stated so cogently nearly 204 years ago on Independence Day. The Red Sea is not the Gulf of Mexico, Long Island Sound or the Gulf of Catalina. That means that the Houthi’s only real offense, which is attempting to blockade ships heading to Israel in retaliation for the latter’s genocidal assault on Gaza, is Jerusalem’s business to treat with, not Washington’s. Moreover, the US Navy has not been hired by the UN or any other global body to safeguard every sea lane on the planet from the Suez Canal to the Straits of Hormuz and the Straits of Malacca. Nor should it take the assignment if offered because the homeland security of America does not depend upon Washington functioning as the gendarme of the world. The fact is, if Washington had not foolishly placed warships in harms’ way in the Red Sea, monitoring the doings of the Houthi would be of such trivial relevance to the homeland security of America as to be assignable to a small staff of White House interns jabbering on Slack. There would be no need for secrecy at all, and even the CNN “war correspondents” wouldn’t much care. In the section below, we will therefore address what Washington’s idiotic war on the Houthi is really about, but suffice it here to remind that US homeland security has nothing to do with the Red Sea or the navigation routes depicted in the graphic above. To the contrary, it’s narrowly and precisely about two things and two things only. prevention of nuclear attack or blackmail. repelling a conventional military invasion and occupation of US territory. Neither are even remotely possible at present by any power on planet earth. And when it comes to the Houthis and their Iranian backers, any potential threat doesn’t even register on the richter scale of national security. Moreover, assurance of that impossibility does not require aircraft carriers or military bases strung around the planet. Nor American servicemen positioned in harm’s way for no good reason of homeland security, as are the US warships plying the Red Sea today. As to nuclear blackmail, there is no nation on earth that has anything close to the First Strike force that would be needed to totally overwhelm America’s triad nuclear deterrent force, and thereby avoid a retaliatory annihilation of its own country and people. After all, the US has 3,800 active nuclear warheads and they are spread under the sea, in hardened silos and among a bomber fleet of 66 B-2 and B-52s—all beyond the detection or reach of any other nuclear power. For instance, the Ohio class nuclear submarines each have 20 missile tubes, with each missile carrying an average of four warheads. That’s 80 independently targetable warheads per boat and at any given time 12 of the 14 Ohio class nuclear subs are actively deployed, and spread around the planet’s ocean bottoms within a firing range of 4,000 miles. So that’s 960 deep-sea nuclear warheads to find and neutralize before any would be blackmailer even gets started. And then there are the roughly 1,200 nukes aboard the 66 strategic bombers, which also are not sitting on a single airfield Pearl Harbor style waiting to be obliterated, but are constantly rotating in the air and on the move. Likewise, the 400 minutemen missiles are spread out in extremely hardened silos deep underground. Needless to say, there is no way, shape or form that America’s nuclear deterrent can be neutralized by a blackmailer. And the best thing is that the nuclear triad costs only $75 billion per year to maintain, including allowances for periodic upgrades, and needs no foreign bases or launch pads, at all. At the end of the day, the only other potential military threat to the homeland security of America is invasion by a massive conventional armada of land, air and sea-based forces many, many times larger than the military behemoth that is now funded by Washington’s $950 billion defense budget. The logistical infrastructure that would be needed to control the vast Atlantic and Pacific Ocean moats surrounding North America and to sustain an invasion and occupation force on the North American continent is so mind-mindbogglingly vast as to be scarcely imaginable. At the least, it would take a $50 trillion GDP to support such a thing—or obviously far more than the mere $2 trillion GDP of Russia or even the $18 trillion GDP of the Red Ponzi in China. So, most surely, the microscopic sliver of GDP under Houthi control ($7 billion) is an utter joke in the scheme of things. Moreover, it’s not as if in an age when the sky is flush with high tech surveillance assets that such a massive conventional force armada could be secretly built, tested and mustered for surprise attack without being noticed in Washington. There can be no repeat of the Akagi, Kaga, Sōryū, Hiryū, Shōkaku, and Zuikaku strike force steaming across the Pacific toward Pearl Harbor sight unseen. As a practical matter, Russia has only one aircraft carrier and China has just three— two of which are refurbished rust buckets purchased from the remnants of the old Soviet Union, and which carriers do not even have modern catapults for launching their strike aircraft. Likewise, neocon knuckleheads have been jabbering about China’s growing Navy, which numbers 400 hulls compared to 305 ships in the US Navy’s fleet. But what they don’t say is that most of these Chinese units are coastal patrol boats, which likely couldn’t even make it to the coast of California, anyway. In terms of Naval power projection capability, the proper measure of lethality is not the number of hulls, but the total displacement tonnage. In this connection, the US Navy has 4.6 million tons of displacement, averaging 15,000 tons per ship. By contrast, China’s Navy has but 2.0 million tons of displacement, averaging only 5,000 tons per boat. That is to say, the Chinese Navy is totally visible, assessable and trackable, and is not remotely of the size and lethality that would make an invasion of America remotely plausible. In other words, all of today’s Uniparty prattle about maintaining freedom of navigation in the Red Sea, Persian Gulf, Straits of Taiwan and Malacca and many more makes sense only through the false lens of a Washington-based Global Hegemon. Indeed, for those in the Trump entourage who think Washington is obliged to keep the peace everywhere on the planet and safeguard all the sea lanes and all the air space from quarreling local parties, as per the prior professions of Little Marco Rubio and national security advisor Walz, let them advise the Donald to call a special session of Congress to declare yet another war on Yemen, as did the hapless Woodrow Wilson in April 1917 to no avail except the resulting rise of Hitler, Stalin, World War II, the holocaust and the Cold War. But the truth is, Washington has been launching not very secret bombing raids on the Houthi for months because it has waded yet again into the long-running spat between Israel and its Arab and Islamic neighbors. Yet as unfortunate as that may be for the inhabitants of Gaza, the West Bank and Israel itself, it does not threaten either the peace or even the commerce of the globe. If it did, then the most immediately impacted parties would be the heaviest shippers and neighbors on the Red Sea. For instance, Saudi Arabia lives on the Red Sea, with major ports at Jeddah, Yanbu, Jubail and the massive futuristic investment at Neom. Likewise, China sends more containership cargo through the Red Sea by far than any other nation. And, of course, Egypt collects the tolls from the Suez Canel through which the Red Sea traffic transits. So, has Saudi Arabia, China or Egypt joined Washington’s one-nation “coalition” to bomb the daylights out of the Houthi? No, they haven’t! But what is especially rich is all the handwringing from the Washington neocons about the 9% of global seaborne oil traffic that traverses the Red Sea/Suez route. The fact is, however, the US is now a net energy exporter. So higher oil prices would actually be a slight benefit economically. But actually, despite the latest kerfuffle over the Houthi interdiction of Red Sea traffic, there has been no visible impact on global oil prices since October 7, 2023, even if you make use of a magnifying glass. So what in the hell, exactly, are they talking about? Daily Price Of Brent Crude Since October 2021 Yes, until Israel comes to terms with its neighbors, seaborne traffic from China and the Far East may be diverted into the longer route from Asia around the Cape of Hope. But so what? The distance from Shanghai to Rotterdam through the Red Sea is just under 6,000 miles versus 9,400 miles around the Cape. That adds another third to the trip, but all the bleating from Washington about the extra costs is really too much—just 12% on traffic to the USA as we indicated above. The fact is, the minor Houthi disruption of commercial traffic on the Red Sea is just one more reminder of why the US doesn’t need any of its 700 global bases, nor 100,000 military personal in Europe and roughly 100,000 in Korea, Japan and elsewhere in Asia, as well. And most especially it does not need aircraft carriers in the Red Sea, the Mediterranean Sea and the Persian Gulf—nor 50,000 American troops in Syria, Iraq. Kuwait, Bahrain etc. These latter forces depicted below (sans Afghanistan), in fact, are all sitting ducks in harms’ way, waiting to get caught in the crossfire of local Shiite/Sunni conflicts or Israel’s perpetual conflict with its Arab and Muslim neighbors in the region. Yet all these forces would do exactly nothing to deter nuclear blackmailers or global armadas heading for the New Jersey shores, if such existed, which they do not. And, no, there is not a sinister monster state in Iran behind all of the commotion, either. Iran poses zero threat to America’s homeland security. Period. It has no missiles capable of reaching the US and has no nukes at all, and would never get any had Trump not cancelled the 2015 nuclear agreement that Tehran was fully complying with. The fact is, even though all of these bases and US naval forces in the middle east region are of no benefit whatsoever to America’s homeland security, they are also actually a profound disservice to the security of Israel, as well. That is to say, just as in the case of loud-mouth adventurists in the Baltics and Poland, who poke the Russian Bear because the NATO Article 5 mutual defense commitment putatively has their back, Israel’s rightwing politicians operate on the same perverse incentives. Owing to the US military shield, which is once again on display in the pointless bombings of the Houthi, Israel’s right-wing religious fanatics led by Bibbi Netanyahu continue to sabotage a two-state diplomatic solution and, instead, make war on their encircled enemies to the bitter end. And they are enabled to do so without leveling with the Israeli electorate about the true implications of going it alone as a Warfare State. Thus, in the case of the Hamas matter currently at hand, if Israel wanted to safely and permanently incarcerate the Gaza strip and its 2.1 million population in an open-air prison, then it needed not only the Iron Dome to protect its population against Hamas’ primitive rockets, but also a full-time garrison along the border to putdown any breach of the Wall, and thereby preempt anything remotely like the catastrophe of October 7th. To put a fine point to it, the Gaza strip is 25 miles long or 131,000 feet. If you put one IDF soldier every 6 feet, that’s a 22,000-man requirement. And on a 24/7 four shift basis that’s 88,000 troops in total at an average cost of $40,000 per soldier plus $20,000 for the overhead and generals. Overall, we are talking $5 billion of incremental military expense to make the Gaza prison break-proof, which amounts to about 1% of Israel’s $550 billion GDP. All along, that’s been part of the unacknowledged incremental cost of the Garrison State alternative to a two-state settlement. It would have meant appreciably higher taxes on Israel’s citizen, but the bloody and barbaric breach by Hamas fighters on October 7th would have never happened, either. In truth, however, Israel never even considered tightening its own economic belt to pay for the war policy that its militaristic and religious extremist government insisted upon. Netanyahu ceaselessly campaigned for decades implicitly on behalf of a Garrison State national security policy, but one funded on the cheap via a quasi-pacifist defense spending level. That’s right. Israel’s military expenditures had plunged from more than 20% of GDP at the time of the last existential crisis during the Yom Kippur War of 1973 to just 5% of GDP on the eve of the October 7 attacks. In effect, Netanyahu falsely told Israeli voters that they didn’t have to take the risks and make the territorial concessions implicit in a two-state and diplomatically-based solution to the Palestine problem. But at the same time, they could also avoid having to be taxed to the gills to pay for the alternative—a costly, heavily militarized Garrison State. The wink and nod underlying this false solution, of course, was a pitiless willingness to keep Hamas in check by “mowing the grass” every few years in Gaza, as a desperate Israeli government has done once again to the horror of much of the civilized world. So even more than the failure of Israel’s vaunted intelligence operations in the run-up to the October 7th massacres, the real deep policy failure is the flaccid blue line in the chart below, slouching toward 5.0% of GDP defense spending after the Netanyahu coalition came to dominate policy in the 1990s. You simply can’t have a Garrison State policy—no negotiations with the Palestinians, no two-state solution, no continuation of the Oslo or other international negotiations process and the quarantine of 2.1 million largely destitute Palestinians in a congested dysfunctional strip of land cheek-by-jowl with the Mediterranean Sea—on a 5% of GDP war budget. In short, Israel’s $25 billion defense budget is a pittance compared to its booming, technologically advanced and robust $550 billion national economy. The latter, in turn, is 20X larger than what had been the $28 billion that passes for an economy in the shambles of Gaza—a whisp of GDP mainly funded by foreign philanthropists and so-called malign actors in the region. And even that will soon virtually cease to exist. Even if you count a few hundred million per year of aid from Iran and others that flows through Qatar to Hamas, there is simply no contest. Israel is an economic Goliath relative to the thin resources of the Hamas terrorist apparatus and does not need a US military shield in the region to ensure its survival. It just needs a government that will tell voters the truth about the real cost of the Netanyahu policy of perpetual war. Needless to say, Bibi Netanyahu and his coalition of rightwing religious parties would have likely never stayed in power with their “rejectionist front” policy against an internationally brokered and superintended two-state arrangement had they leveled with the public about the immense increase in military spending and taxes these policies required. But even that is not the half of it. The truth is, Netanyahu is a megalomaniacal madman who has had the reckless audacity to pursue an utterly dangerous Machiavellian strategy of promoting and funding Hamas in order to kill dead as a doornail any prospect whatever of a two-state arrangement. The public record makes absolutely clear that this is what Netanyahu has done, even as he failed to tell the Israel’s public that this policy, in turn, necessitated a full-bodied Garrison State with painful tax increases to keep his Frankenstein monster contained inside the Gaza prison walls. Israel Tax Revenue As % Of GDP, 1995 to 2021 For want of doubt, the facts are these. Between 2012 and 2018 Netanyahu gave Qatar approval to transfer a cumulative sum of nearly one billion dollars to Gaza in the form of suitcases full of cash. And at least half of that is estimated to have reached Hamas, including its military wing. According to the Jerusalem Post, ……in a private meeting with members of his Likud party on March 11, 2019, Netanyahu explained the reckless step as follows: The money transfer is part of the strategy to divide the Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. Anyone who opposes the establishment of a Palestinian state needs to support the transfer of the money from Qatar to Hamas. In that way, we will foil the establishment of a Palestinian state (as reported in former cabinet member Haim Ramon’s Hebrew-language book “Neged Haruach”, p. 417). In an interview with the Ynet news website on May 5, 2019, Netanyahu associate Gershon Hacohen, a major general in reserves, said, “We need to tell the truth. Netanyahu’s strategy is to prevent the option of two states, so he is turning Hamas into his closest partner. Openly Hamas is an enemy. Covertly, it’s an ally.” Indeed, earlier that spring Netanyahu himself was widely quoted as saying during the aforementioned meeting of Likud MKs that, “Whoever opposes a Palestinian state must support delivery of funds to Gaza (cash in suitcases from Qatar) because maintaining separation between the PA in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza will prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state.” So Israel’s governing faction of religious extremists, militarists, messianic settlers and Eretz Yisrael ideologues have chosen, instead, to live in a Garrison State and to be periodically compelled to “mow the grass” in the Gaza outdoor prison. Yet if its rightwing governments want to operate a modern-day Sparta, they need to tap their own taxpayers first. In the meanwhile, the Donald and his minions need to truly sober up. Uncle Sam’s checking account is massively overdrawn. Now is not the time to fund wars which do nothing for America’s homeland security (Ukraine) or to perpetuate yet another war on behalf of an “ally” that is unwilling to pay for the Garrison State its own blood-soaked, perpetual war policies require. * * * The amount of money the US government spends on foreign aid, wars, the so-called intelligence community, and other aspects of foreign policy is enormous and ever-growing. It’s an established trend in motion that is accelerating, and now approaching a breaking point. It could cause the most significant disaster since the 1930s.

"2025-04-14 11:15:00,Blinken Says US Rare-Earths Deal Actually Originated With Zelensky,""Blinken Says US Rare-Earths Deal Actually Originated With Zelensky Former US Secretary of State Antony Blinken made an unexpected admission during a recent CNBC interview while discussing the topic of President Trump's controversial rare earths minerals deal with Ukraine. Not only did Blinken appear to approve of some kind of rare earth minerals plan which would benefit the US, but disclosed that the Biden administration was working on something similar - albeit he characterized the current White House as having the wrong approach. """"Part of the victory package that [Zelensky] put on the table in the last six months of our administration included us working with them on rare earths, on critical minerals ,"""" Blinken told journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin in the televised interview. He also described 'frustrations' between the Biden admin and Zelensky government, but said the White House under Biden was unwilling to make these public. Biden was reportedly seeking direct investments in Ukraine's rare earths sector. To be expected, Blinken slammed the way that Trump is going about putting together a minerals deal, which some critics characterizing it as a big resource grab at a moment Ukraine remains vulnerable and at war. """"What I think we saw put forward in the deal that was proposed was basically a protection racket, without the protection. We want all of this stuff, but you're really not going to get much for it in terms of protection against Russia from us ,"""" Blinken emphasized in the comments. A key caveat of Trump's plan is for Ukraine to reimburse all the assistance the US has provided in the wake of Feb. 2022. Interestingly Blinken lays out that a minerals plan to 'pay back' America actually originated with Zelensky, albeit in a softer form... 😑 Ukraine offered the US Ukrainian rare earth deal in exchange for military aid, """"it was one of his (Zelenskyy's) parts of the Victory Plan,” former US Secretary of State Blinken pic.twitter.com/G8X7vPncz6 — Iuliia Mendel (@IuliiaMendel) April 11, 2025 Zelensky and his European allies have balked at this, and there's been intense haggling over the plan ever since. It seems White House demands have only gotten wider in scope, however. But Kiev is also in a desperate position, and feels it has to entertain Trump's plan on some level, given that US-supplied weapons and intelligence could be completely cut off once again. Trump earlier ordered a halt to weapons for a matter of a few days, but the arms pipeline has since been back on. Watch Blinken's full CNBC interview which aired last Thursday below...

"2025-04-14 13:55:00,""'Welfare Cliff' Continues: UK's £100,000 Childcare Tax Trap Punishes Success Once Again"",""'Welfare Cliff' Continues: UK's £100,000 Childcare Tax Trap Punishes Success Once Again It's been the case for years that government entitlements have provided low-income families with a higher standard of living than those earning substantially more. But, as we pointed out in 2010 and 2012 that 'benefit' can backfire as """"work is punished."""" """"the single mom is better off earning a gross income of $29,000 with $57,327 in net income & benefits than to earn gross income of $69,000 with net income and benefits of $57,045. """" Fast forward to the pandemic , and we find that the $2.2 trillion 2020 CARES (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economy Security) Act left many employed Americans making less than their unemployed counterparts. For minimum wage and low wage workers the difference between what they are being paid to work and would receive on unemployment is no doubt the most crushing. Many struggle to pay their bills as is and receive no benefits to complicate the equation. While they are dodging coughs and bringing in masks from home for $10 an hour, others who made the same money are now being paid to sit safely at home. Now, the same thing is happening in the UK, where getting a raise could leave one thousands of pounds poorer. Welcome to the childcare cliff , a policy anomaly so irrational that a mere £1 pay rise can leave parents worse off by tens of thousands . This September, the government’s expansion of free childcare in England - offering 30 hours of weekly care for children under three - was meant to ease the burden on working families. But for any household where one parent earns more than £100,000, this support vanishes entirely. It’s a line drawn in concrete. Earn £99,999? Full benefits. Earn £100,000? You lose thousands. Jeremy Hunt has withdrawn tax-free subsidies for working parents after they start earning £100,000 A 50% Raise Just to Break Even According to new analysis from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) cited by the Financial Times , a London-based parent with two young children would need to earn over £149,000 just to break even vs. a colleague earning £99,999 who receives full childcare support. That’s a nearly 50% raise required simply to stand still. And the system doesn’t stop there. As soon as you hit six figures, the personal allowance - the first £12,570 of tax-free income - begins to taper off . Combined with other clawbacks, this creates an effective marginal tax rate of 60% for earnings between £100,000 and £125,140 (and is even higher in Scotland). In practical terms, this turns a middle-class promotion into a financial landmine . Parents Penalized for Working The result is both absurd and tragic: professionals across the country are turning down promotions , cutting their hours, and abandoning second children altogether - not for personal reasons, but because the math just doesn’t work. FT reader Davina (name changed to maintain anonymity), a finance worker and mother of two, has dropped to a four-day workweek just to remain eligible for childcare benefits. “This year, we are £250 per month better off as a result, although I know that going part-time has affected my promotion prospects,"""" she told FT , adding """" I feel bad for complaining, as we aren’t poor, but we’re still spending £2,750 per month on childcare even after the government help, and the reduction in my take home pay means we can’t afford holidays or a car."""" Others are stuffing bonuses into pensions just to stay under the line—sacrificing near-term cash flow for long-term retirement savings they can’t touch for decades. 'Rob,' a tech worker, rejected two promotions to avoid the cliff . Eventually, he quit to become a contractor, sacrificing stability for income he could control. He and his wife made a brutal decision: they won’t have a second child . These aren’t isolated cases, they’re rational responses to irrational policy. One FT reader had to pause fertility treatment after a modest raise triggered thousands in unexpected taxes. Others are gaming the system with salary sacrifice , electric vehicle schemes, and leave-buying tricks. Some have gone self-employed , precisely to limit taxable income. And across sectors, women are disproportionately going part-time , often doing full-time work for part-time pay just to preserve childcare support. In the NHS - where long hours and defined-benefit pensions make income unpredictable, the effects are especially damaging. Consultants are turning down shifts to stay below the threshold. Some doctors, including those in cancer care and psychiatry, say they can’t afford to work more . """"I am a hospital consultant, and feel trapped by this,"""" another person ('Martha') told the Times . """"I have tried to put as much as possible into my NHS pension, but I am really worried about what my tax bill is going to be next year. I can’t take on any extra work for the NHS because it would penalise me too much."""" Fiscal Drag Becomes Fiscal Punishment The £100,000 threshold was set in 2017 . It hasn’t moved since. Had it tracked inflation, it would now sit above £130,000. But instead, more than 1.8 million taxpayers now fall within range , with that number expected to climb as frozen thresholds and rising salaries collide. This stealth taxation - known as fiscal drag - helps Chancellors raise billions without raising headline rates . But it creates cliffs, not curves , and encourages less work, not more . IFS economists say that by 2028, 2.2 million people will fall into this trap , facing both the childcare cliff edge and the personal allowance taper. Fixing this mess wouldn’t be cheap, but it wouldn’t be unaffordable either. The IFS estimates that scrapping the childcare cliff edge entirely would cost a few hundred million pounds - a rounding error in the national budget. The true cost of inaction, however, is likely far higher: lost productivity, lower tax receipts, stalled careers, and family planning decisions dictated by HMRC . Dan Neidle of Tax Policy Associates is blunt: “This is what happens when successive governments try to hide the real tax rate with tricks. What started as a small anomaly is now a serious problem.” The political calculus is simple: it’s easier to complicate the lives of a few high earners than face the wrath of the many. But as this broken system snares more and more working families, inaction is becoming a choice with economic—and human—costs.

"2025-04-14 05:00:00,""Escobar: Why China Won't Call The """"Tariff-Wielding Barbarian"""""",""Escobar: Why China Won't Call The """"Tariff-Wielding Barbarian"""" Authored by Pepe Escobar, The Toddler Temper Tantrum-style Trump Tariff Tizzy (TTT) , now accelerated to 145% – and counting – is yet another thunderous trademark pigeon smashing the chessboard gambit. It won’t work. Trump claimed that China would call him to “make a deal”. That’s reality show territory. Reality is more like the statement by the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council: “Given that U.S. exports to China already have no market acceptability under the current tariff rates , if the U.S. further imposes additional tariffs on Chinese goods, China will simply ignore them. ” Translation: keep vociferating/tariffing. We don’t care. And we will stop buying from you. Anything. The Chinese Foreign Ministry: A “tariff-wielding barbarian can never expect a call from China.” Basic numbers. China’s GDP for 2025 is projected at 5%. U.S. imports account for at best 4% of Chinese GDP. China’s share of total exports to the U.S. dropped to 13.4 per cent in 2024. Goldman Sachs – not exactly a CCP “mouthpiece” – has just projected that TTT will cost China only 0.5% of GDP in 2025, while costing no less than 2% of U.S. GDP. Talk about blowback. Still, from now on, what matters most for Beijing is to keep diversifying the supply chain. Asia-wide, the extra wheels are in motion. President Xi Jinping will soon start an ASEAN mini-tour (Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia). The Shanghai Cooperation Organization – increasingly focused on geoeconomics – is about to meet. The EU, for all the mendacity of its “elites”, is absolutely itching to strike trade deals with China. Zhao Minghao, deputy director at the Centre for American Studies at Fudan University, in Shanghai, refers to the current incandescence as “a game of strategic resolve.” Previously, the eminent Wang Yiwei, international relations star professor at Renmin University in Beijing and an expert on the New Silk Roads, noted that the current tariff rate already made China’s exports to the U.S. “almost impossible”. This analysis noted how China started to deal with TTT with a “courtesy before force” approach, then turned to “we don’t care”, while cultivating “the art of timing” in its asymmetric attack on U.S. stocks. A fascinating window on the real wheels of Chinese trade is offered by a timely visit to the vast Yiwu International Trade City , the largest concentration of small traders on the planet. Less than 10% of Yiwu’s phenomenal amount of business involves the U.S. Among the 75,000 business operators in Yiwu Small Commodity City, only a little over 3,000 do business with the U.S. Two Sinophobes meet one mirage TTT is largely the product of two crude Team Trump arrogant/ignorant Sinophobes, economic advisor Peter Navarro and Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent, who know less than zero about all things China. In fact it was Bessent who right at the start gave the game away: “This was driven by the president’s strategy… You might even say that he goaded China into a bad position. They responded. They have shown themselves to the world to be the bad actors, and we are willing to cooperate with our allies and with our trading partners who did not retaliate.” A crude trap. With the sole focus on China. That had nothing to do with the initial tawdry plot line: tariffs, Mafia-style, on most of the planet, penguins included. If you don’t retaliate, fine. If you do, we hit harder. of the so-called “Miran mirage” – after Trump’s alleged economic brain Stephen Miran. What is actually happening, fast, bypassing the stupid notion that tariffs will be paid for by current depreciation elsewhere ( see Miran’s white paper here ), is the uncontrolled demolition of the U.S. as a world trade center. Asked why he paused the tariffs, Trump answered: “I thought people were jumping a bit out of line. They were getting a little bit yipee. They were getting afraid.” Nonsense. Trump cannot possibly admit on the record that the U.S. oligarchy, Jamie Dimon and co., freaked out big time"
"2025-04-14 05:35:00,What $1 Million Can Buy In Prime Real Estate Around The World,""What $1 Million Can Buy In Prime Real Estate Around The World Across global luxury property markets, $1 million doesn’t go as far as it used to. In Dubai, for instance, a $1 million dollar property in 2020 is worth $2.7 million today. Meanwhile, in Miami, it would be worth $1.9 million. However, in some markets, cracks are beginning to show amid higher rates and frothy valuations spurred by the pandemic. This graphic, via Visual Capitalist's Dorthy Neufeld, shows what $1 million can buy in prime real estate across 20 markets worldwide, based on data from Knight Frank . Luxury Properties Are Getting Pricier Below, we show the square footage that $1 million covers across luxury real estate markets, defined as the top 5% of residential listings as of 2024: As we can see, $1 million covers just 205 square feet in Monaco , with an average new build costing a staggering $39 million in 2024. Monaco’s appeal for the ultra-rich largely stems from its tax-haven status as it has no income tax, inheritance tax, or capital gains tax. Additionally, the scarcity of land met with high demand contributes to high property values. Despite economic challenges, Hong Kong ranks as the second-most expensive luxury market. While many properties of Chinese real estate tycoons have sold at a sharp discount since the collapse of China Evergrande, it still commands top dollar for the most exclusive residences. Overall, buying power has moderately decreased compared to 2014 levels. On the other hand, buying power has risen notably in London due to a falling pound against the dollar and a property market correction. Over the last decade, it has increased by 43%, the biggest jump across cities analyzed. In many ways, this bucks the trend of a majority of prime real estate markets globally. In particular, Dubai has seen buying power drop 59% since 2014, followed by Miami (-54%) Lisbon (-51%), and Shanghai (-47%) amid robust demand and rising affluence.

"2025-04-14 12:00:00,What Europe Overlooks About The Trump Administration's Defense Policy,""What Europe Overlooks About The Trump Administration's Defense Policy Authored by Sarah Kuehberger and Wilson Beaver via The Daily Signal , a publication of The Heritage Foundation , Since the election of President Donald Trump, Europeans have been vocal in their criticism of nearly every U.S. policy issue, often professing that “ transatlantic relations are over ” and “ this government does not care much about the fate of Europe .” This negative sentiment, echoed by politicians and amplified by a biased media landscape , has led to a rapid decline in European trust toward their longest-standing ally. Amidst their frustration over differences in perspective, Europeans should pause and consider the underlying goals of current U.S. foreign and defense policy, rather than resorting to cheap insults. While there has indeed been a seismic shift in transatlantic relations, this change should be regarded as positive. The Trump administration believes that America’s allies must strengthen themselves, as peace can only be achieved through strength. The US Has Been Carrying the Weight Since World War II, the United States has consistently maintained hundreds of thousands of soldiers in Europe to deter first Soviet, then Russian aggression. They helped rebuild Western European economies through the Marshall Plan and provided the nuclear umbrella for the continent. Despite these sacrifices, concerns about burden-sharing are unfortunately not a new issue. Even during the early years of the NATO alliance , when significant threats loomed over the European continent, the U.S. spent disproportionately more on defense. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, many European countries reduced their defense spending , relying on the “peace dividend” and assuming U.S. protection would continue. In 2006, NATO defense ministers formally agreed that members should aim to spend at least 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense to ensure military readiness. However, compliance remained low , and the same impulse continued through the Obama years. During the first Trump administration, NATO members finally started taking the warnings more seriously, albeit reluctantly at first. Today, even NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte acknowledges the impact , stating, “President Trump, thanks to him, we pushed up the defense spending.” The US Can’t Be as Generous as It Was Europeans take pride in their welfare states, but they should acknowledge that these were subsidized by the American security guarantee, which reduced Europe’s defense spending concerns and enabled investment in other areas. Unfortunately, times are changing, and given the geopolitical threat posed by the rise of Communist China, the U.S. can no longer be as generous as it once was. This reality, underscored by Secretary of State Marco Rubio at last week’s foreign ministers conference in Brussels, means that Europe must step up its efforts. The US Won’t Leave Europe High and Dry Shifting priorities doesn’t mean the U.S. is leaving Europeans defenseless. Rubio has clearly acknowledged the Trump administration’s commitment to NATO , despite anxious comments to the contrary. The current geopolitical moment necessitates that the United States focus its efforts on the rise of China. For this vision to succeed, European NATO members will need to assume responsibility for the bulk of conventional deterrence in Europe. This should not be seen as a burden but as a reality of life and an opportunity for greater operational autonomy for European NATO members. American conservatives do not want a Europe that is fully dependent on the United States. Instead, they are seeking to build up a strong and prosperous Europe that can project power in its own neighborhood and act as a force for stability with minimal American assistance. Europeans should welcome this and rise to the occasion. Tyler Durden Mon, 04/14/2025 - 05:00"",https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/what-europe-overlooks-about-trump-administrations-defense-policy"

The alleged arsonist's social media posts reportedly show a history of animus against President Biden and those who voted for him. 🚨 JUST IN: Trump issues new statement on the arson and attempted m*rder of Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro. “The attacker was not a fan of Trump, I understand… wasn’t a fan of anybody, was just a whack job.” “A thing like that cannot be allowed to happen.” pic.twitter.com/UHwj4kR7ru — Eric Daugherty (@EricLDaugh) April 14, 2025 Authorities say Cody A. Balmer, a 38-year-old resident of the capital city of Harrisburg, managed to leap the perimeter fence, break into the mansion and then use homemade incendiary devices to start multiple fires before fleeing the scene. While police were alerted to a breach before the fires were started , they failed to locate the arsonist before he did his work, and also failed to find him before he scaled the same fence and escaped. More than a dozen hours later, Balmer was arrested at an unspecified Harrisburg location. Cody Balmer's social media feed includes this shot of him demonstrating poor trigger discipline, the Daily Mail reports Channeling a """" l'etat, c'est moi """" vibe, Gov. Josh Shapiro told reporters, “Last night, we experienced an attack, not just on our family, but on the entire Commonwealth of Pennsylvania . I want you all to know that your prayers lift us up, and in this moment of darkness, we are choosing to see light.” Shapiro was jarred from his sleep at 2 am by a state trooper who banged his door to alert the 51-year-old, first-term governor to the emergency, and then rush him and his family out of the structure. Last year, Shapiro escaped a different kind of harm when he wasn't chosen as Kamala Harris's running mate. The arsonist caused significant damage to the governor's mansion (Commonwealth Media Services) A Daily Mail exploration of Balmer's social media profiles uncovered a photo of him pointing a handgun at the camera, various posts expressing disdain for President Biden and his supporters, and a potential allusion to political violence. """"Biden supporters shouldn't exist, """" he posted to Facebook in January 2021. """"Where were you his first run? Well aware of the trash he is. As for the second, still knew what scum he is. Now why did y'all forget? What, because he did?"""" Five days later, he posted, """"RIP Joe Biden... Whoops that's in may , #notmypresidenteither"""" In another post, he said """"Knowing is half the battle... the other half is extreme violence."""" From the Daily Mail report, it's unclear what """"knowing"""" Balmer was referring to. The Daily Mail says this is a self-portrait Balmer posted to Facebook State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens gave Balmer high marks for his deliberate execution of the raid: “He clearly had a plan. He was very methodical in his approach, and moved through it without a lot of hurry.” Balmer will face various charges that are expected to include attempted murder, aggravated arson, terrorism and aggravated assault against an enumerated person. (Yes, that last charge represents the state valuing the lives of government employees more than it values yours.) The lack of any indication of conspiracy charges suggests police initially believe Balmer acted alone . Police say they have not yet determined a motive for the fiery but mostly peaceful attack, and it's uncertain if the timing -- at the beginning of the Jewish Passover holiday -- relates to the fact that Shapiro is a Jew. Contemplating that possibility, Shapiro struck a defiant tone: “If he was trying to terrorize our family, our friends, the Jewish community, who joined us for a Passover Seder in that room last night, hear me on this: we celebrated our faith last night, proudly and in a few hours, we will celebrate our second Seder of Passover.” Shapiro also denounced political violence, whatever its target: “ This kind of violence is becoming far too common in our society, and I don’t give a damn if it’s coming from one particular side or the other . Directed at one particular party or another, one particular person or another. It is not OK. And it has to stop, we have to be better than this."""" However, in September, Shapiro enthused over a different kind of political violence , as he hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the enormous General Dynamics facility in Scranton that manufactures 155mm artillery shells that the United States has supplied Ukraine in mass quantities. Shapiro faced a social media backlash when he signed the shells destined for the bloody Western proxy war against Russia.

Sources familiar with Apple's supply chains told Nikkei Asia that top suppliers in India were instructed to ramp up iPhone production. Yet the people noted that factory utilization rates were already at maximum levels, making it challenging to bring on significant amounts of new production. Here's more from the report: Apple has helped suppliers purchase equipment that could increase iPhone production in India by several million units, one of the people told Nikkei Asia. The company expects to produce at least 50 million iPhones there this year and is pushing to make the majority of its upcoming iPhone model bound for the U.S. in India. It has also told suppliers that the majority of MacBooks and iPads for the U.S. market need to be made in Vietnam, sources briefed on the matter said. Apple also asked suppliers to ship as many components and parts from China as possible to Southeast Asia and India to support the increasing production for a wide range of products for the U.S. market, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. The good news for Apple over the weekend is that U.S. Customs and Border Protection issued updated trade guidance on some of the highest-value goods—such as computers, chips, and smartphones—from reciprocal tariffs (though they remain subject to a 20% basic tariff if made in China). However, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told This Week host Jonathan Karl on Sunday that these consumer devices will be subject to separate tariffs in the coming months. After Pres. Trump exempts tech like phones, computers and chips from new tariffs, Commerce Sec. Howard Lutnick tells @JonKarl they will be included in semiconductor tariffs to be released in coming months. “This is not a permanent sort of exemption.” https://t.co/p9xXrT2Xvx pic.twitter.com/RoVH72kfM1 — This Week (@ThisWeekABC) April 13, 2025 Last week, Appel scrambled five emergency air freight shipments of iPhones and other products from India and China to the U.S. to avoid the tariff war. Trade data via the supply chain platform Sayari shows that Foxconn India is a major iPhone supplier. Nikkei's report also noted that Apple informed suppliers to """"accelerate the shift of component production, such as printed circuit boards, to Thailand and other non-China locations."""" """"We are requested to ship all of our components to Southeast Asia and India by air as much as possible. ... It's like the client is scooping up all the inventories to move them outside of China,"""" said an executive with an Apple component supplier, adding that his company will have to shoulder the extra air-shipping costs. """"Apple is very serious about auditing multiple sites in Thailand for component production,"""" a manager at another key Apple supplier told Nikkei Asia. """"The accelerating diversification out of China is ongoing."""" Meanwhile, Meta, HP, and Dell have also instructed suppliers to increase production in Vietnam and other Southeast Asia countries to avoid China tariffs.

"2025-04-14 15:40:00,""US Strips Benefits From Thousands Of Criminal Aliens, Those On Terror Watchlist"",""US Strips Benefits From Thousands Of Criminal Aliens, Those On Terror Watchlist Authored by Chase Smith via The Epoch Times, The Trump administration has ended temporary immigration parole and revoked federal benefits for thousands of foreign nationals flagged as national security risks, part of a broader effort to roll back immigration programs implemented under the Biden administration. According to White House officials, more than 6,300 individuals who were paroled into the United States during or after 2023 were identified as having criminal records or were listed in the FBI’s Terrorist Screening Database. Their parole was terminated starting April 8. As part of the enforcement action, the Social Security Administration reclassified those individuals’ Social Security numbers into its Ineligible Master File, a restricted database that prevents improper payment of federal benefits. Formerly known as the Death Master File, the system is used to ensure that only lawfully eligible individuals can access programs such as Social Security, Medicaid, and other federally administered aid. Immigration parole allows certain noncitizens to temporarily enter and remain in the United States, during which they may receive work authorization and Social Security numbers if granted parole for more than one year. White House assistant press secretary Liz Huston said the action fulfills President Donald Trump’s campaign pledge to enforce immigration laws more strictly. “President Trump promised mass deportations, and by removing the monetary incentive for illegal aliens to come and stay, we will encourage them to self-deport,” Huston said in an emailed statement to The Epoch Times. “He is delivering on his promise he made to the American people.” The policy change follows a March 25 notice in the federal register from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS ) formally ending the CHNV parole programs. Those programs, created in 2022 and 2023, allowed approximately half a million citizens of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, along with their immediate family members, to request authorization to enter the United States and apply for parole under categorical criteria. “DHS has determined that it is now appropriate and necessary to terminate the CHNV parole programs,” the notice stated. “These programs do not serve a significant public benefit, are not necessary to reduce levels of illegal immigration, did not sufficiently mitigate the domestic effects of illegal immigration, are not serving their intended purposes, and are inconsistent with the administration’s foreign policy goals.” DHS also noted that the parole period for individuals still present in the United States under CHNV authority will end on April 24, unless the secretary of Homeland Security makes an individual exception. Those without a lawful basis to remain after that date must depart voluntarily or face enforcement. The changes are being implemented under Executive Order 14165, Securing Our Borders, signed by Trump on Jan. 20. The order directed the department to terminate parole programs deemed inconsistent with the administration’s immigration priorities.
